# cuda_intro

This project reflects continuing work and projects I undertake during a course on parallel programming written by NVIDIA.

Technologies: C++, NVIDIA CUDA

Kernels are written for image processing, making use of 2D kernel block and grid layouts. 
The code is executed through Udacity's portal due to not currently having access to a cuda-capable device. 
All source material is provided, including results/outputs.
